The Enhydris version has the form

    major.minor.micro


Here's how to release a new minor version X.Y.0:

    1. Update the release notes.

    2. Create a branch:

          git checkout -b X.Y

    3. In enhydris/__init__.py change the value of __version__ so that
       it has the value "X.Y.0" (should be "dev" before you change it).

    4. Commit:

          git commit -a -m "Version X.Y.0"

    5. Create a tag:

          git tag X.Y.0

    6. Push the new branch and the new tag:

          git push origin X.Y
          git push origin X.Y.0

    7. Create a new release in github.

    8. Upload to pypi:

         ./setup.py sdist upload


Here's how to release a new micro X.Y.Z version:

    1. Switch to the X.Y branch:

          git checkout X.Y

    2. Make the required bug fixes, add them to the release notes
       under the (probably new) X.Y.Z heading, and commit them.

    3. In enhydris/__init__.py, change __version__ so that it has the
       value "X.Y.Z" (should be "X.Y.Q" where Q=Z-1).

    4. Commit:
    
          git commit -a -m "Version X.Y.Z"

    5. Create a tag:
    
          git tag X.Y.Z

    6. Push changes and tag:

          git push
          git push origin X.Y.Z

    7. Create a new release in github.

    8. Upload to pypi:

         ./setup.py sdist upload

    9. Also apply the bug fixes to the master branch. On the release
       branch:
       
          git log --oneline -n5
          git checkout master
          git cherry-pick [commits]
