Here's how to release a new micro 0.1.Z version:

    1. Switch to the 0.1 branch:

          git checkout 0.1

    2. Make the required bug fixes, add them to CHANGES.txt under the
       (probably new) 0.1.Z heading, and commit them.

    3. In the toplevel __init__.py, change __version__ so that it has the
       value "0.1.Z" (should be "0.1.Q" where Q=Z-1).

    4. Commit:
    
          git commit -a -m "Version 0.1.Z"

    5. Create a tag:
    
          git tag 0.1.Z

    6. Push changes and tag:

          git push
          git push origin 0.1.Z

    7. Create a new release in github.

    8. If needed, also apply the bug fixes to the master branch and
       other release branches.
